            <p>Scouting is a worldwide movement that helps young people develop physically, intellectually, emotionally, and socially through a structured program of activities and challenges. It's more than just an outdoor adventure—it's about creating responsible citizens and building lifelong skills.</p>
            
            <h2 class="subheading">History of the Scouting Movement</h2>
            <p>
                Scouting began in the early 20th century as a youth movement aimed at fostering character, leadership, and outdoor skills. It was founded by Lord Robert Baden-Powell, a British Army officer, in 1907. Baden-Powell’s inspiration came from his experiences in the military, particularly during the Second Boer War in South Africa, where he saw the value of resourcefulness and outdoor skills in young men. He believed that such skills could be useful not only in war but in civilian life as well, helping boys become more self-reliant and better citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1907, Baden-Powell organized the first experimental Scout camp on Brownsea Island in Dorset, England, gathering 20 boys from different social backgrounds to teach them camping, woodcraft, teamwork, and loyalty. This camp was a success and marked the beginning of a global movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scouting spread worldwide after the publication of Baden-Powell’s book "Scouting for Boys" in 1908, which outlined the principles and activities of Scouting. By 1910, the Boy Scouts of America was formed, and Scouting became an international phenomenon. Today, more than 50 million Scouts participate in programs that develop life skills, citizenship, and leadership abilities across more than 170 countries.
